# RPLidar A1 with ROS2 Humble Distribution
This is my personal documentation of RPLidar and ROS2 implemented in VirtualBox Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)
RPLidar is a lowcost Lidar 360. RPlidar A1 adopts laser triangulation technology, and with SLAMTECâ€™s high-speed vision acquisition and processing mechanism, it can measure the distance data of more than 8000 times/second. [here](https://www.slamtec.ai/home/rplidar_a1/) is full documentation in the Slamtec webpage. This lidar allow me to do some cool SLAM projects, especially for autonomous RC car and drone.
